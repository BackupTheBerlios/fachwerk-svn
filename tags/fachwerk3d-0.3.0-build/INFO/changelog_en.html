Fachwerk - Changelog
--------------------

version		date		changes

0.30		26.08.07	New functions
				- Propose member forces
				  Based on elastic calculation.
				  Assumption: EA,c = 10 EA,t (iterative calculation)
				- Find node position
				  A node will be moved along a straight line, until a required member force
				  is achieved.

				Details
				- Rare bug in the solver fixed.
				  Caused message "Contradiction" even though model was ok (only when mechanism check switched off).
				- Deletion of members and nodes without reconfirmation, if not set / connected to members.

0.22*		18.02.07	Details
* not released			- more functions accessible by function keys

0.21		24.09.06	New function
				- Mouse wheel zooming

				Details
				- Labelling of the load and bearing force arrows
				- Print System shows mechanism.
				- Error message shown in status line if saving fails.

0.20		28.07.06	New functions
				- Kinematic method (mechanisms)
				  Fachwerk3D additionally applies the kinematic method to the model.
				  If the model is instable *and* does not respect equilibrium conditions, an according mechanism is drawn.
				  This feature simplifies finding errors in statically indeterminate models.

				Details
				- enhanced solver
				- number of statical indeterminancy shown on console output

0.10		13.11.05	New functions
                                - Pan
                                  middle mouse button or Ctrl-key and left mouse button
                                - Scaling of loads
				- Help

				Details
				- Verbose console output
				- Source code cleanup

0.05		3.07.05		not published
				- Split members

0.04		20.04.05	New functions
				- Status line for members
				  In addition to the member force, its components are displayed.

				Look
				The default LookAndFeel is the one of Java 1.4, also for Java 1.5.
				
				Details
				- File name in title of program window.
				- Keybord quick access: save, print and reset of calculation.
				- Member and Node property dialogs
				  The most frequently used field has the focus after opening the dialogs.
				  Escape key aborts the dialogs.
				- Node property dialog
				  Enter key puts the cursor in the next field resp. closes the dialog (=OK).
				- Open file dialog
				  The first time a background drawing is loaded, the dialog shows the directory of the .fwk model file. 
				  Previously the users home directory was shown instead, when the program was started by clicking on a fwk file.

0.03		5.12.04		Usage and Look
				- The view and the zoom do not change when a new member is
				  created or when the properties of a member are changed.
				- A right click on a member or on a node opens its property
				  dialog.
				- The input data can be exported into a table that can be opened
				  by any spreadsheet application. Useful for finding input errors.
				- The LookAndFeel has been changed, due to the new standard look of
				  Java 1.5. It was hard to see if a button was pressed.
				  The previous look can be obtained using the option 
				  "fachwerk3D --look Java".
				  
				Details
				- Keybord quick access: F9 calculate, F11 select node, F12 select member.
				- Bug fixed: A load was not shown in the status line if both the x- and
				  z- components were equal zero.
				- The function "create node (snap)" gets deactivated when clicking
				  somewhere else than on a background point.
				- Member property dialog: Enter has the same effect as a click on the
				  "change"-button.

0.02		26.10.04	Several features ported from Fachwerk0.10:
				- Background drawings (3D): dxf, bgd, csv
				- Creating nodes snapping to a background point
				- transformations: scale or move the strut-and-tie model
				- transformations: scale or move the background drawing
				- Keybord quick access: F5 New node, F7 New Member, DEL, etc.
				- Colt version 1.2.0 used (instead of 1.1.0).

0.01		21.09.04	Initial publication of the program (GPL)

0.01		15.08.04	First internal release of Fachwerk3D
				- Based on Fachwerk 0.09 (with a small enhancement for ver. 0.10)
