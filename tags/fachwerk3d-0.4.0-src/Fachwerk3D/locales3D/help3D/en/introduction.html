<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h4>Purpose of the program</h4>
<p>«Fachwerk3D» is aimed at structural engineers who analyse and design
<i>reinforced concrete structures</i>. Is is the spatial version of the program «Fachwerk».
It intends to simplify the application of
discontinuous stress fields and strut-and-tie models.</p>
<p>The program calculates strut-and-tie models. It only uses
equilibrium conditions. Thus, unlike common programs, it does not
assume elastic material behaviour.</p>
<p>If the modelled system is hyperstatic, Fachwerk3D will nevertheless calculate
the forces of the members that are determinate. One can assign
forces to the remaining members. If more forces than needed to accomplish
a statically determinate system are assigned to members,
Fachwerk3D  will indicate that the system is inconsistent (except
equilibrium is fulfilled anyway).</p>

<h4>The program is <i>not </i>suitable for...</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p><i>steel constructions</i>.<br>While Fachwerk3D can
	calculate the axial forces of truss beams, there are better
	suited programs for this purpose.<br><br>
	</p>
	</li><li><p>calculations of <i>bending moments</i>.<br>The program
	only knows compressive and tensile forces.<br><br>
	</p>
	</li><li><p>calculations of <i>deformations</i>.<br>The program only
	uses equilibrium conditions. It does not know anything about
	elastic deformations.
	</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Less is more</h4>
<p>If a statical problem may be solved using a plane model, it is usually better to do so rather than using a spatial model. Three-dimensional strut-and-tie models often need a large number of members and therefore get complex. It should also be considered that «Fachwerk» is more advanced than its spatial pendant «Fachwerk3D».</p>
<p>Of course there are some cases that justify the application of spatial models and so «Fachwerk3D» may be usefull.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h4>Difference to other programs?</h4>
<p>Every program for frame analysis can calculate trusses and,
therefore, is able to find a possible solution that respects the
equilibrium conditions. However, there is a problem if the system is
statically indeterminate. The common linear-elastic programs
calculate the forces according to the rigidity of the members. For
the calculation of strut-and-tie models (for reinforced concrete
structures) however, the rigidity of the members has no meaning and should,
consequently, not be used. Instead, one may want to assign the
yielding force of a number of reinforcement bars to a tie of the
model. That is what «Fachwerk3D» is designed for.</p>
<p>The <a href="algorithmus.html">algorithm</a> of the program is not
based on the usual approach of inverting the stiffness matrix. For
that reason, «Fachwerk3D» is able to calculate (internally
or externally) <i>unstable systems</i>, assuming that the equilibrium
conditions are not neglected. In practice that means that you don't
have to introduce bearings or stabilisers that are not necessary for
the equilibrium.</p>
