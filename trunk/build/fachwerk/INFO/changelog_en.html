Fachwerk - Changelog
--------------------

version		date		changes

0.13		13.11.05	New functions
				- Pan
				  middle mouse button or Ctrl-key and left mouse button
				- Scaling of loads

				Details
				- Verbose console output
				- Splitting of a member with set force
				  One of the two new members inherits the set force
				- Additional functions available in French
				- Source code cleanup

0.12		27.03.05	New functions
				- Split members
				- Status line for members
				  In addition to the member force, its horizontal and vertical components are displayed.
				
				Details
				- File name in title of program window.
				- Keybord quick access: save, print and reset of calculation.
				- Member and Node property dialogs
				  The most frequently used field has the focus after opening the dialogs.
				  Escape key aborts the dialogs.
				- Node property dialog
				  Enter key puts the cursor in the next field resp. closes the dialog (=OK).
				- Open file dialog
				  The first time a background drawing is loaded, the dialog shows the directory of the .fwk model file. 
				  Previously the users home directory was shown instead, when the program was started by clicking on a fwk file.

0.11		21.02.05	Usage and Look
				- The zoom does not change when a new member is
				  created or when the properties of a member are changed.
				- A right click on a member or on a node opens its property
				  dialog.
				- The LookAndFeel for Java 1.5 is now the same as for Java 1.4.
				  So it is easy to see if a button is pressed.
				  The Java 1.5 default look can be obtained using the option 
				  "fachwerk --look Ocean".
				- dxf-drawings: Layers that are frozen or turned off are not shown anymore.
				  
				Details
				- Keybord quick access: F9 calculate, F11 select node, F12 select member.
				- The function "create node (snap)" gets deactivated when clicking
				  somewhere else than on a background point.
				- Member property dialog: Enter has the same effect as a click on the
				  "change"-button.

0.10		30.09.04	New functions
				- New Node, Snap
				  It is now possible to create a new node using the snap function. (Snap to the background drawing.)
				- Move Node
				  Snap to background points and lines.
				- Background drawings
				  In addition to the dxf-format, bgd and csv are supported. The new format bgd allows to create background drawings easily using a text editor. So background drawings can be used even if no CAD-program is available.
				  
				Usability
				- Keybord quick access
				  F5 New node, F7 New Member, DEL, etc.
				- Move Node
				  Moving in x- or z-direction.
				  
				Details
				- Message: OK COMPLETE
				  A message appears in the status line and on the printed system output, if all the member and bearing forces are known.
				- Colt version 1.2.0 used (instead of 1.1.0).
				  The new version is smaller.
				- Console output
				  The scope of the console output has been reduced, unless an error occurs.

0.09		22.06.04	New functions
				- Background drawing
				  Drawings (dxf) can be read into the new background-layer. The layer can be
				  switched on or off like the other layers and can be printed as well.
				  The following dxf-entities are read in: Line, Polyline, LWPolyline, 
				  Circle, Arc, Point. Text will not be shown. You can scale or move the
				  drawing, but not modify it.
				- Zoom Out button
				- Transformation of coordinates
				  You can scale or move the strut-and-tie model.
				  
				Usability
				- Load / Save
				  By default, only files with the ending ".fwk" are shown.
				- New member / new node
				  The choice of layers is restored after adding a new node or member.
				- Arrows
				  The length of the arrows now depends on the layers that are switched on.
				  If you hide the bearing forces, you'll better see the loads.
				  
				Details
				- Program icon for Windows (format "ico") added.
				- Visual appearance: Some icons on buttons have got better contraste and font
				  size has been increased.
				- English and french translations: Abbreviation for node changed to "nd".
				- Printing: Length of arrows shortened (see also above).
					
				Source code
				- Recoded to Unicode UTF8.
				  (Fachwerk and tcldxf. Colt unchanged.)
				- Memory consumption to draw lines reduced. (In order to display large dxf-files
				  on older computers.)
			 

0.08		11.05.04	New function
				- Print graphic
				  The graphical representation of the model can be printed as seen on the screen.
				  The zoom and layer settings are respected. The scale can be specified.
				  
				Details
				- Print system
				  The arrows that indicate the external forces are drawn larger. The circles that
				  represent the nodes are smaller. These mesures increase the visibility of small arrows.

0.07		08.02.04	New functions
				- Finding node position
				  A node will be moved along a straight line, until a required member force
				  is achieved. This function simplifies the modelling of deviated compression
				  members (i.e. compression arch).
				  The function may be used to find the exact node position so that the member 
				  force in a «stabilizer» really is zero. Thus that member can be removed.
				
				Starting options
				- "fachwerk file.fwk" directly opens the file.
				  This allows you to link *.fwk - files to the program Fachwerk,
				  i.e. in Konqueror (Linux/KDE) or Explorer (Windows). Therefore the working
				  directory must be the directory where Fachwerk is installed.
				- "fachwerk --help" shows the available options.
				- "fachwerk -l fr" starts the program in French. Analogous "-l en", "-l de"
				  (The previous option "fr" without "-l" or "--language" does not work anymore.)
				
				Simple installation / clear licence
				- The library for mathematics "colt" is already included in the zip-file.
				  It is not necessary to download it separately.
				- Colt version 1.1.0 used (instead of 1.0.3). The new version is smaller.
				- The new colt version contains only "free" licences. That's why the library
				  is now delivered with the program.
				  (The previous version contained a package that did not allow commercial use.
				  The package however was not used by Fachwerk. Now the hole library is freely
				  usable.)
				  
				Visual appearance
				- Clear icons on the buttons "select a node" and "select a member".
				- Member forces and numbers labeled parallel to the member.
				- Bold font used for assigned member forces. Thus better recognisable on
				  black-and-white print-out.
				  
				Details
				- Inserting new node: Small visual bug fixed:
				  In the previous version the snap-marking remained even when the mouse cursor
				  was not over the node anymore.
				- Node properties window (Bearing forces): Force rounded to one decimal place.
				  (Previously by mistake rounded to integer.)
				- Node properties window (Bearing condition): The node automatically gets marked
				  "sliding" when the sliding direction has been changed.


0.06		30.12.03	First multilingual release
				- Internationalisation of most part of the code.
				- French and English translations
				- English help (not complete)
