 This program certainly contains some ERRORS. <strong>All results must be verified
 CAREFULLY in order to state that they are PLAUSIBLE!</strong><br>
<br>
 Fachwerk3D calculates three-dimensional strut-and-tie models used by structural engineers for analysing
 and designing reinforced concrete structures. The program only uses the equilibrium
 conditions, thus it is not assuming elastic behaviour. If the system is statically
 indeterminate, the redundant forces can be set.
 program aims to simplify the application of the theory of plasticity's
 lower bound (static) theorem.<br>

<h4>START:</h4>
<pre>
 Linux:         type «./fachwerk3d»
                or «fachwerk3d» if you installed it using rpm.
 
 Windows:       type «fachwerk3d» (or double click "fachwerk3d.bat")

 Command line options
        "fachwerk3d datei.fwk3d"    directly opens the file.
				  This allows you to link *.fwk3D - files to the program Fachwerk3D,
				  i.e. in Konqueror (Linux/KDE) or Explorer (Windows). Therefore the working
				  directory must be the directory where Fachwerk3D is installed.
				  
        "fachwerk3d --help"       shows the available options.

        "fachwerk3d -l fr"        starts the program in French. Analogous "-l en", "-l de".
	
	"fachwerk3d --look Java"  sets th LookAndFeel. Analogous "--look System", "--look undef"
