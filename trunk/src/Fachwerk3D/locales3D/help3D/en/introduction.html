<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h4>Purpose of the program</h4>
<p>The program «Fachwerk3D» addresses to structural
engineers who are involved with analysing and designing <i>reinforced
concrete structures</i>. Is is the spatial version of the program «Fachwerk».
It intends to simplify the application of
discontinuous stress fields and strut-and-tie models.</p>
<p>The program calculates strut-and-tie models. It only uses the
equilibrium conditions. Thus, unlike common programs, it is not
assuming elastic behaviour.</p>
<p>If the system is statically indeterminate, the program calculates
the forces of the members that are determinate anyway. You can assign
forces to the remaining members. If you assign more forces to members
than needed to accomplish a statically determinate system, the
program will indicate that the system is inconsistent (except
equilibrium is fulfilled anyway).</p>

<h4>The program is <i>not </i>suitable...</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>for <i>steel constructions</i>.<br>Of course the program can
	calculate the axial forces of truss beams. However there are more
	suited programs.<br><br>
	</p>
	</li><li><p>for calculations of <i>bending moments</i>.<br>The program
	only knows compressive and tensile forces.<br><br>
	</p>
	</li><li><p>for calculations of <i>deformations</i>.<br>The program only
	uses the equilibrium conditions. It doesn't know anything about
	elasticity.
	</p>
</li></ul>

<h4>Less is more</h4>
<p>If a statical problem may be solved using a plane model, it is usually better to do so rather than using a spatial model. Three-dimensional strut-and-tie models often need a large number of members and therefore get complex. It should also be considered that «Fachwerk» is more advanced than its spatial pendant «Fachwerk3D».</p>
<p>Of course there are some cases that justify the application of spatial models and so «Fachwerk3D» may be usefull.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h4>Difference to other programs?</h4>
<p>Every program for frame analysis can calculate trusses and
therefore is able to find a possible solution that respects the
equilibrium conditions. However, there is a problem if the system is
statically indeterminate. The common linear-elastic programs
calculate the forces according to the rigidity of the members. For
the calculation of strut-and-tie models (for reinforced concrete
structures) however, the rigidity of members has no meaning and
therefore it should not be used. Instead, you may want to assign the
yielding force of a number of reinforcement bars to a tie of the
model. That is the function the present program «Fachwerk»
is designed for.</p>
<p>The <a href="algorithmus.html">algorithm</a> of the program is not
based on the usual approach of inverting the stiffness matrix. For
that reason, «Fachwerk3D» is able to calculate (internally
or externally) <i>unstable systems</i>, assuming that the equilibrium
conditions are not neglected. In practice that means that you don't
have to introduce bearings or stabilizers that are not necessary for
the equilibrium.</p>
