<p>Most of the menu items are self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Main</h3>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/fileprint.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="16">
print system</h4>
<p>The printout contains much information and therefore it is well
suited for the documentation of the modelling.<br>The upper third of
the sheet is used for the graphical representation of the truss
(«zoom all»). The layers 'member forces', 'loads' and
'bearing forces' are being printed. Below all the nodes and members
are listed, showing their coordinates, loads and member forces.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/fileprint.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="16">
print graphic</h4>
<p>The graphical representation of the model will be printed. The
zoom and layer settings will be respected. You can specifiy the
scale.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/fileopen.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="18" width="18">
load</h4>
<p>You can find examples in the directory «fachwerk/bsp».</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/dxf.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="16">
load background</h4>
<p>A background drawing in the format <a href="backgrounddrawing.html">dxf</a>,
<a href="backgrounddrawing.html">bgd</a> or <a href="backgrounddrawing.html">csv</a>
can be read in. When you save your strut-and-tie model, the
background drawing will NOT be saved.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/locale.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="16">
language</h4>
<p>Choose the application language. The item «system»
stands for the default value of your computer. That is actually the
preset value when the program starts. The item «...»
allows to choose the language by typing its abbreviation: «de»
for German, «en» for English or «fr» for
French. If other translations are available (i.e. Russian), you can
choose it («ru») this way.<br>If you want to start the
program directly in English (but your system's default is not
English), call the program the following way: «fachwerk
--language en».</p>

<h3>View</h3>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/zoom.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="16" width="16">
zoom xy</h4>
<p>Enter the limiting x- and z-coordinates to set the zooming window.</p>

<h3>Truss</h3>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/knotenselektieren.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="21" width="21">
select node nr ..</h4>
<p>If there are several nodes at the same position, it can be useful
to select a node by its number.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/eraser.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="21" width="21">
remove</h4>
<p>The node or the member to be removed must be selected previously,
otherwise nothing happens. If you remove a node, all the members
connected to it will be removed too.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/clear_left.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="21" width="21">
reset all</h4>
<p>Resets the calculation and resets all the assigned member forces
to indeterminate.</p>
<h4><img src="../../../gui/icons/designer.png" align="bottom" border="0" height="21" width="21">
properties</h4>
<p>Opens the properties window of the previously selected member or
node.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>
<p>Each of the following calculation methods can be activated or
deactivated. Normally both static methods are activated.</p>
<h4>preconditioning</h4>
<p>Often the <i>number of unknown member forces</i> can be <i>reduced</i>
by this method.<br>Additionally the algorithm serves to <i>localize
inconsistencies</i> in the nodes equilibrium.<br>The 'preconditioning' can be turned off safely.</p>
<h4>solver</h4>
<p>The system of equations contains two equilibrium conditions for
each (open) node. The global equilibrium contributes three
equations.<br>This solver has a special quality: it finds determinate
member and bearing forces, even if the system as a hole is statically
indeterminate.<br>Usually the 'solver' <i>must </i>be turned <i>on</i>.</p>
<h4>mechnisms (kinematic method)</h4><p>The program looks for
mechanisms proving that equilibrium is not satisfied. A mechanism is
shown graphically. Mechanisms due to instabilities that do not
contradict equilibrium are disregarded.<br></p><p><br>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<p>This item contains features that extend the basic functions of the
program.</p>
<h4>transformation of coordinates</h4>
<p>Scale or move the coordinates of the nodes. The scaling operation
is applied first.</p>
<h4>transformation of background</h4>
<p>Scales or moves the background drawing. The original dxf-file
remains unchanged. Preferably this transformation is done in the
program that is used to create the drawing, because any
transformation done within Fachwerk will not be saved.</p>
<h4>scaling of loads</h4>
<p>Scales all the loads with a factor. Member forces that have been set can be scaled too.</p>
<h4>find node position</h4>
<p>The selected node will be moved along a straight line, until a
required member force is achieved.<br>Example: Find the exact node
position in order that the member force in a «stabilizer»
really is zero. Afterwards you can remove that member.<br>First
select the node you want to move. You will be asked for a vector. The
straight line is actually defined by the initial node position and
this vector. If the node contains a load, the vector of the force
will be proposed. The vector is also used to define the second
starting point of the iteration.<br>If no node position is found,
that leads to the required member force, the initial situation will
be restored. (I.e. because the member force is independent of the
node position, or because the iteration using the given starting
points doesn't converge.)</p>
<h4>propose member forces</h4>
<p>Proposes member forces if the system is statically indeterminate. 
The calculation is linear-elastic and assumes a ratio compression to 
tension stiffness  EA,c/EA,t = 10<br> One has to judge if the proposed 
member forces are reasonable for the given case.</p>
