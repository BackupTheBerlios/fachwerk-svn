<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h4>Purpose of the program</h4>
<p>«Fachwerk» is aimed at structural engineers who analyse and design
<i>reinforced concrete structures</i>. It intends to simplify the application of
discontinuous stress fields and strut-and-tie models.</p>
<p>The program calculates strut-and-tie models. It only uses
equilibrium conditions. Thus, unlike common programs, it does not
assume elastic material behaviour.</p>
<p>If the modelled system is hyperstatic, Fachwerk will nevertheless calculate
the forces of the members that are determinate. One can assign
forces to the remaining members. If more forces than needed to accomplish
a statically determinate system are assigned to members,
Fachwerk will indicate that the system is inconsistent (except
equilibrium is fulfilled anyway).</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Discontinuous stress field models are suitable for the design and
detailing of reinforced concrete structures. The method (based on the
theory of plasticity) is graphic and clear. The statical action and the strength
can be analysed in a consistent manner. In many cases, this method can
easily be applied by hand. Sometimes, however, a computer program would
be helpful to calculate the model. The time saved could be used for
the thorough development of stress fields and for the detailing.</p>
<p>To the author's knowledge, there is no publicly available computer
program for the calculation of general plane stress fields. A practicable
procedure is to first draw the stress field model and then to convert
it into a strut-and-tie model. The members of the truss represent the
resultants of the compression fields and of the reinforcement.
This approach is applicable in many cases.</p>

<h4>Difference to other programs?</h4>
<p>Every program for frame analysis can calculate trusses and,
therefore, is able to find a possible solution that respects the
equilibrium conditions. However, there is a problem if the system is
statically indeterminate. The common linear-elastic programs
calculate the forces according to the rigidity of the members. For
the calculation of strut-and-tie models (for reinforced concrete
structures) however, the rigidity of the members has no meaning and
should, consequently, not be used. Instead, one may want to assign the
yielding force of a number of reinforcement bars to a tie of the
model. That is what «Fachwerk» is designed for.</p>
<p>The <a href="algorithmus.html">algorithm</a> of the program is not
based on the usual approach of inverting the stiffness matrix. For
that reason, «Fachwerk» is able to calculate (internally
or externally) <i>unstable systems</i>, assuming that the equilibrium
conditions are not neglected. In practice that means that you don't
have to introduce bearings or stabilisers that are not necessary for
the equilibrium.</p>
